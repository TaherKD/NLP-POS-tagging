# NLP-POS-tagging
Hidden Markov models and Viterbi algorithm for POS tagging

In this assignment, we need to modify the Viterbi algorithm to solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques. Though there could be multiple ways to solve this problem, you may use the following hints:

Which tag class do you think most unknown words belong to? Can you identify rules (e.g. based on morphological cues) that can be used to tag unknown words? You may define separate python functions to exploit these rules so that they work in tandem with the original Viterbi algorithm.

Why does the Viterbi algorithm choose a random tag on encountering an unknown word? Can you modify the Viterbi algorithm so that it considers only one of the transition or emission probabilities for unknown words?
 
You have been given a 'test' file containing some sample sentences with unknown words. Look at the sentences and try to observe rules which may be useful to tag unknown words. Your final model will be evaluated on a similar test file.

## Data
For this assignment, weâ€™ll use the Treebank dataset of NLTK with the 'universal' tagset. The Universal tagset of NLTK comprises only 12 coarse tag classes as follows: Verb, Noun, Pronouns, Adjectives, Adverbs, Adpositions, Conjunctions, Determiners, Cardinal Numbers, Particles, Other/ Foreign words, Punctuations.

## Goals
We can split the Treebank dataset into train and validation sets. 

You need to accomplish the following in this assignment:

1. Write the vanilla Viterbi algorithm for assigning POS tags (i.e. without dealing with unknown words) 
2. Solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques. These techniques can use any of the approaches discussed in the class - lexicon, rule-based, probabilistic etc. Note that to implement these techniques, you can either write separate functions and call them from the main Viterbi algorithm, or modify the Viterbi algorithm, or both.
3. Compare the tagging accuracy after making these modifications with the vanilla Viterbi algorithm.
4. List down at least three cases from the sample test file (i.e. unknown word-tag pairs) which were incorrectly tagged by the original Viterbi POS tagger and got corrected after your modifications.
